This chat app allows you to create a server with multiple clients who can send messages, recieve messages and block users.

Execute the .exe file three times. One to set up the server and the last two to set the clients.

## Server 
Set the IP port and choose between simulate database or custom database.
If you create a custom database you will need to enter the host's name, port, name of the database, username and password.

## Client
To setup your client you will need the IP, the port, and a login name, wich will be used later to send the messages.

To send a message click on "Compose message" and fill the fields.
Then, click "Refresh inbox" button on the receiver window.
